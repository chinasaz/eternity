# Eternity

A scientific calculator developed in python that offers a web-based user interface implemented using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/).

## Development

Development process of Eternity included various elements of Agile methodology including:

- Conducting interviews with potential users
- Creating personas for potential users
- Gathering use cases based on analysis of interviews and personas
- Documenting functionalities
- Creating Class Responsability Collborator (CRC) models

along common software development practices such as testing, debugging, and code reviewing.

## Local Setup

The core of Eternity, located in `src` directory, is implemented in vanilla python and can be used as is.

To run the user interface and tests you will need to install the dependencies outlined in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). For convenience, you can use Python's `venv` package to install dependencies in a virtual environment. You can find the instructions on creating and activating a virtual environment in the official [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/venv.html). After setting up and activating your environment, you can install the dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
