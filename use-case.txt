A short paragraph describing the development process of the use case

The process of developing the use case started with each member designing their own diagram based on the needs of their interviewee. 
The initial use cases were missing some of the features of the final version as not all interviewees had the same needs.
After discussion the use cases were combined to accommodate the majority needs of the potential users.
