"""
This module contains the code for a task for the calculator.
The goal of this task is to demonstrate the functionality of
the calculator, more specifically the functionality of
standard_deviation module.
The task involves calculating the mean, population standard
deviation, and sample standard deviation of a set of values.
some values are removed from the set, new values are added 
to the set, and lastly the set is completely changed.
The properties are calculated at each step for comparison
and analysis.
